1. first setup the environment with Terraform and aws-cli 
What are we going to see first: 
- you should understand the workflow 
- you should understan the provider plugin
- what is the TF registry 
- where are the registries located 
- referring to the TF documentation
- how do we get started for the TF configuration and the modules
- what is the workflow
- etc

Once we are comfortable with the concepts above, then we will for the aws side of interacting from Terraform and aws resources etc. 
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION SYNTAX:

Terraform configuration files are plain text files which ends with filename.tf as extension.
HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language)
Terraform uses resource block to create Infrastructure (For AWS: EC2, VPC, S3 etc.,) services on respective provider like AWS, Azure, GCP etc., mentioned in provider block.
hclresource "aws_vpc" "myvpc" {
  cidr_block = var.base_cidr_block
}

<BLOCK TYPE> "<BLOCK LABEL>" "<BLOCK LABEL>" {
  # Block body
  <IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION> # Argument
}

Key takeaways:

Terraform files use the .tf extension
Written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
Infrastructure is defined using resource blocks with the syntax: resource "<provider_resource_type>" "<local_name>" { ... }
The generic block structure is: Block Type → Block Labels → Block Body containing Arguments (identifier = expression)

### one Note, keep track of the deprecation, for that reason try to maintain and stick to one version of Terraform. 
DOCUMENTATION:
OFFICIAL PAGE
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs

REGISTRY
https://registry.terraform.io/
What are registries?
contains multiple providers along with documentations

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
LOCAL PROVIDER 
---------------
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/latest --> click on documentation --> click on Resources > click on local_file
this registery is used to manage local resources, such as creating files etc

you have to understnad what are resources? 
whatever you creating using Terraform is a resource. 

copy the example code from the documentation above.

resource "local_file" "foo" {
  content  = "foo!"
  filename = "${path.module}/foo.bar"
}

#notice the above code has structure syntax like below:
<BLOCK TYPE> "<BLOCK LABEL>" "<BLOCK LABEL>" {
  # Block body
  <IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION> # Argument
}

resource "local_file" "myfirstfile" { # <------------ is not a file name, its a Terraform reference name for the local_file resource.

### so inside this what are the inputs that we need to give for that we need to refer to the DOCUMENTATION
###  The required REQUIRED PARAMETERS are mandatory e.g in documentation it is filename in this local_file resource
filename parameter is required
content is optional, read other optional parameters from the docuemntations

}

resource "local_file" "myfirstfile" { # <------------ is not a file name, its a Terraform reference name for the local_file resource.
  filename
}
### if you dont give the absolute path, it will create the file in the same location
resource "local_file" "foo" {
  filename  = "terraform_file.txt!"
    content   = "This is a first file created by Terraform."
}

filenames are the attriubte of the resource we are creating. All the attributes related to the resource wil be provided in the block.

### UNDERSTANDING THE WORKFLOW
what is the workflow
