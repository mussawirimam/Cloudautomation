Note:
1. If you have multiple resources, example resource A, resource B and there is no dependencies. The terraform will try to execute code for both at the same time.
2. If there are dependency of the resources, then terraform will go through sequence.

RANDOM PROVIDER FROM THE REGISTRY
=================================
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest

when working with any provider, there are required and optional input. You can use those through the 
documentation that the provider comes with. 

### added random provider
root@terra:~/introduction# cat providers.tf 
terraform {
  required_providers {
    local = {
      source = "hashicorp/local"
      version = "2.5.3"
    }
  }
}
    random = {
      source = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "3.8.1"
    }
  }
}

### added the code
resource "local_file" "myfirstfile" {
  filename  = "terraform_file.txt!"
    content   = "This is a first file created by Terraform."
}
resource "random_pet" "mypetname" {
    length = 2
    prefix = "MR"
    separator = "."
}

### but it is giving me error when I do plan because any time we add a new provider, we need to initialize the terraform to download the plugins for the new provider for the code to work. 
root@terra:~/introduction# terraform plan

### I did upgrade because I previously had version 2.5.2 selected but in your case only TF init should work.

TERRAFORM WORKFLOW BEGINS AGAIN
===================================
root@terra:~/introduction# terraform init -upgrade #<-------------------------
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/local versions matching "2.5.3"...
- Finding hashicorp/random versions matching "3.8.1"...
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/local v2.5.3
- Installing hashicorp/random v3.8.1...
- Installed hashicorp/random v3.8.1 (signed by HashiCorp)
Terraform has made some changes to the provider dependency selections recorded
in the .terraform.lock.hcl file. Review those changes and commit them to your
version control system if they represent changes you intended to make.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if
you run "terraform apply" now.

### right now this is random resource is only the word it got created but it (TF) will not store it somewhere, we have to use it/make use of it. And that is something we will learn.

### for now we will learn interpolation sequence
