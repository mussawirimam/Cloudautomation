Note:
1. If you have multiple resources, example resource A, resource B and there is no dependencies. The terraform will try to execute code for both at the same time.
2. If there are dependency of the resources, then terraform will go through sequence.

RANDOM PROVIDER FROM THE REGISTRY
=================================
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest

when working with any provider, there are required and optional input. You can use those through the 
documentation that the provider comes with. 

### added random provider
root@terra:~/introduction# cat providers.tf 
terraform {
  required_providers {
    local = {
      source = "hashicorp/local"
      version = "2.5.2"
    }
  }
}
terraform {
  required_providers {
    random = {
      source = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "3.8.1"
    }
  }
}

### added the code
resource "local_file" "myfirstfile" {
  filename  = "terraform_file.txt!"
    content   = "This is a first file created by Terraform."
}
resource "random_pet" "mypetname" {
    length = 2
    prefix = "MR"
    separator = "."
}

### but it is giving me error when I do plan because any time we add a new provider, we need to initialize the terraform to download the plugins for the new provider for the code to work. 
root@terra:~/introduction# terraform plan
