Assignment 1: The University Roster (Single Inheritance) 🎓
You're building a system to manage people at a university. The most basic entity is a Person. A Student is a specific type of Person.

Tasks:

Create a base class called **Person** with:

An __init__ method that takes name and age as arguments.

A display() method that prints the person's name and age.

Create a child class called **Student** that inherits from **Person**.

Its __init__ method should take name, age, and a student_id. It must call the parent's __init__ method to handle the name and age.

Override the display() method to print the student's name, age, and student ID.

Create an instance of Student and call its display() method to show it works.

Concepts to practice: Single Inheritance, Method Overriding, super().__init__().



Assignment 2: Geometric Shapes (Hierarchical Inheritance) 📐
You need to model different geometric shapes. All shapes have a name, but they calculate their area differently.

Tasks:

Create a base class **Shape** with:

An __init__ method that takes the name of the shape.

A placeholder method area() that does nothing but pass.

Create two child classes, **Rectangle** and **Circle**, that both inherit from **Shape**.

The **Rectangle** __init__ should take name, width, and height. It should implement the area() method to return width * height.

The **Circle** __init__ should take name and radius. It should implement the area() method to return 3.14 * radius**2.

Create instances of Rectangle and Circle and print their areas.

Concepts to practice: Hierarchical Inheritance, Polymorphism (different area methods).

Assignment 3: Advanced Electronics (Multilevel Inheritance) 💻
Model the relationship between general electronics, computers, and specific types of computers like laptops.

Tasks:

Create a base class **Electronics** with a method power_on() that prints "Electronic device is ON".

Create a child class **Computer** that inherits from **Electronics**. It should have a method run_os() that prints "Operating System is running".

Create a grandchild class **Laptop** that inherits from **Computer**. It should have a method check_battery() that prints "Battery level is 85%".

Create an instance of Laptop and call all three methods (power_on, run_os, and check_battery) to show the full chain of inheritance.

Concepts to practice: Multilevel Inheritance, method chaining.

Assignment 4: The Hybrid Engine (Multiple Inheritance) 🚗
Design a class for a hybrid car that has features of both a gasoline car and an electric car.

Tasks:

Create a class **GasolineEngine** with a method fill_tank() that prints "Gasoline tank is full."

Create another class **ElectricMotor** with a method charge_battery() that prints "Battery is fully charged."

Create a child class **HybridCar** that inherits from both **GasolineEngine** and **ElectricMotor**.

Create an instance of HybridCar and call both fill_tank() and charge_battery() on it.

Concepts to practice: Multiple Inheritance, combining features from different classes.

Challenge Project: The Dungeon Crawler (Hybrid Inheritance) ⚔️
Create a set of classes for a simple text-based adventure game, combining multiple inheritance patterns.

Tasks:

Create a base class **Character** with attributes for name and health.

Create two classes that inherit from **Character**: **Player** and **Enemy**. This is Hierarchical Inheritance.

Create two "ability" classes that do not inherit from Character: **MageAbilities** (with a cast_spell() method) and **WarriorAbilities** (with a swing_sword() method).

Create a final class, **WizardKnight**, that inherits from **Player**, **MageAbilities**, and **WarriorAbilities**. This uses Multiple Inheritance, creating a Hybrid structure.

Instantiate a WizardKnight. It should have a name and health from Character/Player, and it should be able to cast_spell() and swing_sword(). Demonstrate that it can use all its abilities.

Concepts to practice: Hybrid Inheritance, complex class design, Method Resolution Order (MRO).
